Given that this work is a revision of my PhD thesis,
I must also revise my acknowledgements.
No names need be subtracted from the acknowledgements for my PhD thesis,
but several must be added.

First and foremost, and again, I would like to thank
\tbf{Heronimus Bani} and \tbf{Charles Grimes}.
My PhD work would have been a complete disaster without
the groundwork laid by Roni and Chuck and subsequently this book would never have appeared.
I look forward to continuing to to work with them in championing,
in whatever small way I can, the languages and peoples Timor.

Selain itu beta ju mau minta terima kasih buat semua
orang Tunbaun dong dengan orang Buraen dong.
Khususunya \tbf{Om Melo} (Tunbaun) dengan dia pung keluarg,
dan \tbf{bapa Toni} dengan \tbf{mama Ketsia}.
Itu orang dong yang mengajar beta logat Ro{\Q}is.

Secondly, I would like to thank the examiners of my thesis:
\tbf{Anthony Jukes}, \tbf{Daniel Kaufmann} and \tbf{Marian Klamer}.
Their perceptive comments on the submitted version of this thesis
led to many useful revisions of that work, some of which have
taken until now to be fully implemented.

In particular, Daniel Kaufmann suggested
the revised prosodic structure of hosts and enclitics which
has made my analysis of phonological metathesis much clearer
and more typologically plausible.

Marian Klamer provided me with the job during
which I have had the freedom to produce this work.
It is with gratitude that I say here that
revision of my thesis for publication was supported
by the VICI research project ``Reconstructing the past
through languages of the present: the Lesser Sunda Islands''
funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific
Research, project number 277-70-012.

Thirdly, I would like to thank the anonymous reviewers
who read the submitted version of this book.
While it is often frustrating dealing with reviewers comments,
in my experience, they are nearly always on point and 
addressing them properly yields a better result.
I hope these reviewers feel I have honoured the time
they put into assessing this work by properly
considering their insightful criticisms.

Fourthly, I would like to thank the editors of Language
Science Press, Martin Haspelmath and Sebastian Nordhoff
who have guided the manuscript to publication,
as well as the proofreaders XXX who caught the many
typographical errors which remained.

Finally, from almost the instant I submitted my PhD thesis
I have had the pleasure of getting to know \tbf{Kirsten Culhane}.
She has been an incredible friend and conversations
with her have contributed to many different parts of this work.
